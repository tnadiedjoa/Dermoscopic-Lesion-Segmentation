"""Region-merging segmentation, after Celebi et al. (2008).

The image is over-segmented into homogeneous regions, then the regions making
up the lesion are selected by a score. Two over-segmentation backends are
available:

``srm``
    Statistical Region Merging (Nock and Nielsen), implemented here from the
    paper: pixel pairs are visited in order of increasing intensity difference
    and merged through a union-find structure whenever their region means
    differ by less than a statistical bound that tightens as regions grow.
    This is the algorithm Celebi et al. applied to dermoscopy.

``felzenszwalb``
    Felzenszwalb's graph-based segmentation, as a faster reference point. It is
    a different algorithm and is reported separately, never as SRM.

Region selection reuses the observation from Zortea et al. (2017) that a band
along the image border is mostly skin, which gives a reference value without
any training.
